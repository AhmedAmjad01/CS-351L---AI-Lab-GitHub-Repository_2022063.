AI Lab Projects
Overview
Welcome to my repository for the AI Lab course, where Iâ€™ve been working on implementing various Artificial Intelligence algorithms and techniques. This course is taught by Usama Janjua, whose guidance has been instrumental in helping me explore both foundational and advanced AI concepts.

Course Instructor
Usama Janjua

GitHub: https://github.com/usamajanjua9

Usama has been an incredible instructor throughout the course, sharing his expertise on search algorithms, machine learning, and optimization techniques, which has significantly enhanced my understanding of AI.
Lab Objectives
Through this AI lab, I aim to:

Understand and implement different AI algorithms like A*, BFS, DFS, Genetic Algorithms, and the Golden Ratio for optimization.
Apply AI techniques to solve real-world problems, such as grid navigation, number guessing games, and AI in game development.
Gain practical experience by coding solutions in Python to develop AI-driven systems and games.

Projects Included:

1.A Pathfinding for Monster Chasing Game*
I developed an AI-driven game where monsters use the A* algorithm to navigate through a grid and chase the player, adding complexity to the gameplay.

2. Number Guessing Game (BFS and DFS)
I implemented BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithms to create a Number-Guessing game where the AI searches for number.

3. Golden Ratio for Optimization
I applied the Golden Ratio method to optimize and solve problems for the Number Guessing game as well.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: heapq, random, queue, metaplot, pandas, numpy
Algorithms: A*, BFS, DFS, Genetic Algorithms, Golden Ratio
